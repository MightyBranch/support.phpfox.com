# Introduction into Themes with PHPfox

Creating a unique look for your community can be loads of fun and isn't hard at all. Knowing CSS helps, however its not required any longer for PHPfox.

## Creating a New Theme

The first thing we want to look into doing is to create a new theme. To do this, log into your AdminCP and go to:
```
> Themes
```

Find and click on **NEW THEME**

<a href="/themes/managing-themes/" class="next">Managing Themes with PHPfox</a>

> **Note for Developers:** Once you have created a theme you will be redirected to where you can manage your theme.
> While you can edit most factors of a theme from the AdminCP, some might feel more comfortable editing files via an IDE.
> Themes located in: **/PF.Site/themes/**
