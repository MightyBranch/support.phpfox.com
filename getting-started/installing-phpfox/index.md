You are to upload those files and folders to your sites root directory.

## Web Installer

Once all the files have been uploaded, using your web browser of choice visit your site.

The first step of the web install, will be to select what type of license to assign to this copy of PHPfox.

If you have purchased a license and wish to connect to our store front select **Premium**.

The next step will require you to enter your PHPfox License ID & Key, which was sent to you via an email directly after your purchase.

## Database Configuration

PHPfox uses MySQL(i) and you can use a local or remote server. If you do not have or know your database credentials, just contact your host
 and they will point you in the right direction.

Once you have entered all the correct details and run the web installer, it will get everything setup in no time.

## Administrators Account

You are almost done! Your final step will be to create an administrators account. You can change any of the details you add here later,
so don't sweat it. One thing you might want to take a moment to think about, is your password. Make it a good one, your Admin account comes
with great power.
