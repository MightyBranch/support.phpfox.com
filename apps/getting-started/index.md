# Getting Started with Apps

Each app is stored on a clients web server and is developed in PHP.
However, Neutron supports API calls to a clients web server via a unique key, pass and token. This allows you to create
an app in any language of choice, include mobile apps.

## Registering your Company Name

Before creating apps you will need to register your company name (vendor). This only needs to be done the first time you create an
app. This process allows you to later sell your apps on our Store. However, selling your apps is optional.

Let's get started. First, log into your Admin Control Panel. Click on **Apps** and then **NEW APP**.

In the modal popup you will either get the option to create your app or see a message similar to this.

Clicking on the link will take you to PHPfox to register one of your products. Once you **Assign** a product it will take you
back to your site and you should be all set.

## Creating a New App

From your Admin Control Panel click on **Apps** and then **NEW APP**.

In the modal popup add the name of your app and hit **Submit** to be on your way.

> Product name can only contain alphanumeric characters and a dash.

## Guidelines

Before you jump to the next article. In many of the upcoming examples we use terms such as **Acme**, which is used to resemble your
products name. We use **Vendor** to identify your company name. When accessing a URL we use <mark>http://localhost/</mark> and in the examples we provide we always use Short URLs.
