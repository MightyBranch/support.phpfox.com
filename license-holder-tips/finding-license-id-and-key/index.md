# Finding your License ID &amp; Key

When installing an app or theme and if you are asked to enter your sites License ID and Key, there are several ways you can attain this information.

## Option 1: Access license key from web server

If you are running Neutron (v4 or higher) you can access your sites license information by opening the file **/PF.Base/file/settings/license.sett.php**.

In that file you will find something like:
<pre><code class="php">define('PHPFOX_LICENSE_ID', 'c5daa43d32eabb6da3e3ad6966ffa87d');
define('PHPFOX_LICENSE_KEY', 'f353c6edf0293240a372d7876f27832f');
</code></pre>

The 32 character jumble of letters and numbers is your license ID and Key.

## Option 2: Access license via email

If you are running Neutron or Nebula (v3 or v4), and purchased the product after **May 25th, 2015** we send out an email directly after a purchase
has been made with your license ID and key. If you cannot find this email and are unable to access your license file via **Option 1**, feel free to get in [touch with us](http://www.phpfox.com/contact/).

## Option 3: Access license via Clients Dashboard

If you have purchased any version of PHPfox before **May 25th, 2015** you can access all your licenses via our [Store](http://store.phpfox.com/sites).

Once you have logged in, click on any of your sites and then click **Manage**. You will then find your license ID and Key.
