# Installing v3 Modular Apps

Using modules that were developed for v3 can be installed in v4 using very similar methods provided by v3.

## Disclaimer

> This article is intended to explain the method to install modules with v4 and does not guarantee a modules functionality.

> This article tests a 3rd party module, [My Schools](http://store.phpfox.com/product/407/my-schools) developed by Konsort.org.

## PHPfox Base Directory

The first major difference you will notice with v3 and v4 is the directory/file structure. This
is very true at first glance, however if you navigate into the folder **/PF.Base/** you will notice
a very familiar directory structure that is similar to v3.

## Uploading Modular Apps

When you upload any modular app, the instructions provided by the developers usually guide you to upload
their files to your sites root directory, which in v4 would be in the **/PF.Base/** folder.

## Enabling Module from AdminCP

Once you have uploaded all of the modules files, login into your AdminCP. On your dashboard you should find the product.
