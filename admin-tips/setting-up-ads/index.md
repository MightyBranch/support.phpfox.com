# Setting up Ads

As an Admin you can create HTML based ads direct from your AdminCP by creating a new block and placing
the HTML code anywhere on your site in specific block locations.

## Enabling ads for Users

To enable ads for your users to submit and for you to monetize, the first thing you need to create is an **Ad Placement**.

To do this, login into your AdminCP and go to

> Settings > Ad Campaigns

Then click on **Manage Placements** and then **NEW PLACEMENT**

![](/assets/img/create-an-ad-placement.png)

Our ad placements support both **CPM** and **PPC**.

Once you have created a placement you or your users can now create ads if that membership group has permission to do so.

## User Group Permission

Lets make sure users are actually allowed to create ads, by default this is disabled. So lets enable it for Admins.

Head over to

> User Groups > (drop down) Manage User Settings > Ad

Enable **Can create ad campaigns?**

## Creating an Ad

Now that we have an ad placement and that we gave our user group the power to create ads, head over to your site.

At the bottom of any page of your site you should find the link **Advertise**. Visit the page and you should find
a link **CREATE AN AD**.

This is where you and your users can now create ads.
